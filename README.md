# Designing Beautiful Maps with D3.js

## About
This is the repository for a book on creating and designing beautiful maps with
D3.js.

## Objectives
The reader will walk away from this book with the skills to design beautiful and
engaging maps for use in infographics, websites, and publications. The
main tool we'll be using is D3.js, but will include many concepts from the
cartography and design fields that will be transferrable to whatever tools the
reader decides to build maps with in the future.

## Prerequisites
No experience with D3.js or JavaScript will be necessary for readers of this
book. That being said, we'll be focusing on building maps, not the basics of
JavaScript or building websites.

## Technologies
We'll be using the latest version of D3.js (version 4.x) along with ES7 (ES2016).
