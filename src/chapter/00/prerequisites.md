# Prerequisites


## Some Basic Computer Skills
To be able to follow along, you'll need to be able to download and
execute programs from the internet. We'll be opening up text files containing
computer code and editing them. You should be able to open folders on your hard
drive and navigate through to different directories. We'll be running programs
through the command line interface, though when the time comes, I'll explain how
to do that.


## Be Familiar with a Good Web Browser
D3.js is a JavaScript library and the main kinds of maps we'll be making are those
that will be published to websites. You'll need to download and install a modern
web browser that has developer tooling built in. I'll be using
[Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/){:target="_blank"}
throughout this book and recommend you do the same.
[Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox){:target="_blank"}
is also a good choice, though some of the debugging functionality
discussed in this book may be in a slightly different place.

Please do not use
Internet Explorer to follow along with this book.
The Microsoft team is making great strides to increase the
stability and usability of their web browser, but as of right now, there are just too
many different versions out there with widely different functionality depending
on the operating system and browser version combination you have. That said,
many of the maps you'll make will be be viewed by users with various versions of
[Internet Explorer](https://www.microsoft.com/download/internet-explorer.aspx){:target="_blank"},
so it is always a good idea to have access to a few different
versions to check your final maps.


## Get a Good Code Editor
A good code editor is crucial to your development experience. The only way to
get better at programming is to write lots of programs, and if you're always having
to fight your editor, you'll end up hating to program. Find an editor that works
well for you and don't let anyone talk you out of it. I've listed several below that
are acceptable for use with this book. This list, however, is not exhaustive and if
you have a favorite one, by all means use it. The only thing to look for is that it
has some sort of auto-completion and support for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Also, make
sure you're using a *code editor*. Microsoft Word and other text writing software won't
save your files in a format we can run.

[Atom](http://atom.io/){:target="_blank"} - This is my personal favorite and what I use
on a day to day basis. It is free and open source, developed by GitHub, and is especially good
for web and JavaScript development.

[SublimeText](https://www.sublimetext.com/){:target="_blank"} - This is an extremely fast and
lightweight commercial code editor that many people love.

[WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/){:target="_blank"} - WebStorm is another commercial editor
that many respected web developers in the industry love.


## Patience
The computer will always do *exactly* what you tell it to. After fifteen years, I
still need to remind myself of this every day. You'll misspell variable and tag names,
forget semicolons, and close files without saving, blowing away hours of work. You'll
create pages that look great in the latest version of Chrome but look ridiculous in
Internet Explorer or when viewed on a mobile device.

This is all part of the experience and we all go through it. Remember that
programming is part science and part art. It will be extremely frustrating, but can
also be extremely rewording. Keep at it and don't give up.
