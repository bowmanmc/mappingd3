## About
This is the repository for a book on creating and designing beautiful maps with

I'd love some help! There are a few things you need to know to get the project
up and running on your local box:
- Install [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). The exact insctructions
depend on your platform, but the npm scripts used to build this site expect there
to be a "jekyll" command available from a terminal.
- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org). This should include an "npm" executable.
- Open a terminal, navigate to the root of where you checked this project out to, and
execute `npm install`.
- Once that is complete, run `npm start` and open a browser to http://localhost:9000
