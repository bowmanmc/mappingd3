# Designing Beautiful Maps with D3.js

## Michael Bowman

Hello and welcome to Designing Beautiful Maps with D3.js. This book grew out of
a few conference talks I've done and has now been updated to use the latest
version of D3.js and cover ancillary topics important to building maps, such as
cartography and design principles. By the end of this book, you will be able to
not only create maps, but create beautiful and engaging maps to assist you in
telling your story.

All of the code used in this book (as well as the book itself!) is available
on GitHub at [https://github.com/bowmanmc/mappingd3](https://github.com/bowmanmc/mappingd3).
Check there for the latest updates and to file any issues you may find while
reading.
