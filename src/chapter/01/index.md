# Chapter 1.
## An Introduction to Mapping and D3.js

Hello and welcome to Designing Beautiful Maps with D3.js. This book grew out of
a few conference talks I've done and has now been updated to use the latest
version of D3.js and cover ancillary topics important to building maps, such as
cartography and design principles. By the end of this book, you will be able to
not only create maps, but create beautiful and engaging maps to assist you in
telling your story.
