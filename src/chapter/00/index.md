# Road Map

By the end of this book, you should be able to build maps that are
engaging, well designed, and that will assist you in telling a story with your data.
To achieve that goal, we'll need to make several pitstops along the way,
picking up various skills from the cartography, design, and
computer programming disciplines.

We'll get our hands dirty learning about and building several different
types of maps. From soup to nuts, we'll be obtaining the raw data, processing it for our use,
plotting it geospatially, and then designing and tweaking the final product
in a way that best suits our needs.
